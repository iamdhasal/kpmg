I was not able to complete challenge 2 and 3 but some pointers i have on those

Challenge 2 - I belive with the help of terraform we can achieve this ,with Terraform Console we can get the output or data in tfstate file and play with that. 
Challenge 3 - We can acheieve this in Pyhthon - data type Dictionary will give us key value pair and with get() or items() fucntion we can get value for specific index.
